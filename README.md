# Rutgers-APC-RGB-D-Challenge
Amazon Warehouse Picking Challenge. For a graduate class, I developed a pipeline for pose estimation for a few objects in a matter of weeks. This did not use deep learning but implemented OpenCV in Python. </br >
I included my report outlining my process and include a Python script outlining the process while using the Oreo box as an example. Data was used from https://robotics.cs.rutgers.edu/pracsys/rutgers-apc-rgb-d-dataset/
</br >
</br >
Much improvements can be made and automated for use with more objects. This project was done in 3-4 weeks.
