# Rutgers-APC-RGB-D-Challenge
Amazon Warehouse Picking Challenge. For a graduate class, I developed a pipeline for pose estimation for a few objects in a matter of weeks. This did not use deep learning but implemented OpenCV in Python._
I included my report outlining my process and include a Python script outlining the process while using the Oreo box as an example.
